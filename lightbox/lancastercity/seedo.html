				"At age 6, he and his family moved to the King Street home where he spent most of his lifetime. As a young man he traveled to Paris where he was part of the avant garde scene. Though plagued by illness all his life, he produced over a thousand works of art, including the well known "My Egypt" which was inspired by grain elevators in Lancaster. The Demuth home, built in the latter part of the 18th century, is one of the oldest in Lancaster and once served as a Colonial era tavern. Located next door is the Demuth Tobacco Shop. Founded in 1770 it is the oldest tobacco shop in America."
